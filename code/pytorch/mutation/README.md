# Mutation

This folder contains an example to perform mutation for Pytorch API.

## Usage

Run `example.py` under this `mutation` folder to load and mutate an invocation of `torch.nn.Conv2d`. You will get files `example_conv2d.py` and `example_conv2d_mutation.py` under the folder `../output`.

1. `example_conv2d.py`: the python file containing an invocation of `torch.nn.Conv2d`
2. `example_conv2d_mutation`: the python file containing a mutation for the invocation of `torch.nn.Conv2d`
